We release the code for **Seeing Through Deepfakes**, an explainable deepfake detection framework that connects video classification, visual evidence, facial-region analysis, and natural-language explanation generation.

The project is designed around one question: how can a deepfake detector make its decision easier to inspect? Instead of only returning a real/fake label, the pipeline also produces Grad-CAM visualizations, facial ROI activation scores, and an LLM-generated explanation grounded in the model outputs.


```text
Video input
  -> multi-task CNN-LSTM detection
  -> Grad-CAM visual evidence
  -> facial ROI activation analysis
  -> LLM-generated textual explanation
  -> web-based inspection interface
```

The detection model jointly performs:

- **Binary classification:** real vs. fake
- **Manipulation-type classification:** Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, NeuralTextures, FaceShifter, or original

## Project Highlights

- Multi-task video-based deepfake detection using a CNN-LSTM architecture
- Comparison of ResNeXt50-32x4d, Xception, and EfficientNet-b0 backbones
- Grad-CAM-based visual explanation for model-sensitive regions
- Facial ROI activation scoring for region-level interpretability
- LLM-based explanation generation from prediction, method, and ROI evidence
- React + Django demo application for reviewing predictions and explanations together

## Publication

**Seeing Through Deepfakes: An Explainable Multi-Task Detection Framework with Deep Learning and Large Language Models**

Accepted for publication in **Computers, Materials & Continua (CMC)**

🔗 **Online First:** https://www.techscience.com/cmc/online/detail/27664

DOI: https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2026.081091



## Quick Start

To run the local demo, prepare the shared Python dependencies, place the pretrained checkpoint where the backend expects it, then start the backend and frontend applications.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required checkpoint path for the demo:

```text
backend/detection/detector/checkpoint_v35_best.pt
```

Then start the backend and frontend using the [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) and [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md) guides.

By default, the frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API runs at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Model And Data

The deployed demo uses the final EfficientNet-b0 + LSTM checkpoint, `checkpoint_v35_best.pt`. The checkpoint is available from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12VNleCHv1PB7SUnh0H0QBmObUClwUQy3/view).

Experiments use videos from FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeeperForensics. Dataset files are not tracked in Git because they are large and have separate access conditions. See [`Dataset/README.md`](Dataset/README.md) for local layout and rebuilding notes.

## Reproducing Results

The research workflow is documented in [`model/README.md`](model/README.md). At a high level, reproduction follows this order:

1. Prepare and preprocess datasets
2. Generate metadata
3. Train or evaluate the multi-task detector
4. Run Grad-CAM and ROI analysis
5. Evaluate explanation preferences

The corresponding notebooks and helper scripts are maintained under [`model/`](model/).

| Binary + Method | **Binary + Method + ROI** | B preferred | GPT-4o | 49/60 (82%) | 30/30 (100%) | 19/30 (63%) |
| Binary only | **Binary + Method + ROI** | B preferred | Llama3 | 60/60 (100%) | 30/30 (100%) | 30/30 (100%) |
| Binary only | **Binary + Method + ROI** | B preferred | GPT-4o | 60/60 (100%) | 30/30 (100%) | 30/30 (100%) |

## Explainability Output

The explanation pipeline combines visual, regional, and textual evidence.

ABSTRACT = {The recent increase in deepfake content has significantly increased cyber threats. Although numerous deepfake detection technologies have achieved high accuracy, there are limits to clarifying the rationale behind their detection decisions. To bridge the gap, in our study, we leverage the combination of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver clear, consistent, and understandable interpretations of deepfake detection outcomes. To do that, we integrate XAI and LLMs to visually represent detection rationales and automatically generate coherent natural-language explanations. During the implementation of our method, we developed a multi-task learning framework based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, trained simultaneously for binary classification (real or fake) and multi-class classification (identifying specific deepfake techniques) using the FaceForensics++ dataset. The CNN architecture considered for this model included ResNeXt50-32x4d, EfficientNet-b0, and Xception, with EfficientNet-b0 ultimately selected as the optimal detection model based on superior performance metrics on the FaceForensics++ dataset. EfficientNet-b0 achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 95.14% for binary classification and 94.29% for multi-class classification. Additionally, a web-based interface was developed to allow intuitive inspection of the detection results, combining visual and textual explanations to enhance interpretability.},
